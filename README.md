# Cookd

A project I'm building while learning Angular & Typescript, 
for managing and discovering various food recipes.

The web application will be architectured like a SPA, 
eventually communicating with a SQL database via GraphQL - 
consuming a RESTful API and performing CRUD operations. 

### Here's a screenshot!
